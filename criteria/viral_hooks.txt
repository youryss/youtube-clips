# Viral Hooks Criteria

Look for segments that have strong opening hooks or attention-grabbing moments that would make someone stop scrolling.

Key indicators:
- Bold statements or controversial opinions
- Questions that create curiosity
- Shocking facts or statistics
- "You won't believe..." type statements
- Strong emotional openings
- Pattern interrupts (unexpected statements)
- Time-sensitive or urgent language
- Direct challenges to common beliefs

Examples of viral hooks:
- "I made $10,000 in my first month doing this..."
- "Everything you know about X is wrong..."
- "This one trick changed my life..."
- "Why no one talks about this..."
- "The truth about X that nobody tells you..."

Score segments higher if they:
- Start with immediate value or intrigue
- Create an open loop (make you want to know more)
- Challenge the status quo
- Include specific numbers or results
- Have emotional intensity
